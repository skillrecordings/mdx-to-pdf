# Generate PDFs from MDX (feat Razzle)

## Write

1. `yarn start` to spin up the server
2. edit `src/example.md`


### Generate PDF

This example is using `src/example.md` as a source file to generate PDF from. PrinceXML itself is using `build.html` which gets autogenerated from `App.js` every time you make changes and save it.

1. Install [PrinceXML](https://www.princexml.com/download/):

```sh
$ brew tap caius/prince
$ brew install prince
```
_Optionally run `prince --help` to check if Prince is available._

1. Run `yarn pdf` to generate `output.pdf` in root directory.

Control things like pagination, page spreads, page margins, etc. in `src/styles.css` with [Prince's Paged Media CSS rules](https://www.princexml.com/doc/paged/).
